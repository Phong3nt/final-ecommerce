# Evaluation History — Laravel E-Commerce

**Project:** Laravel E-Commerce Platform  
**Purpose:** Record code quality evaluations, test results, bugs, and improvement proposals for every completed task.  
**References:** [backlog.md](backlog.md) · [testing_standards.md](testing_standards.md) · [instruction.md](instruction.md)

---

## How to Use This File

1. **After completing a task**, the Agent appends a new `## EVAL-<TaskID>` block below.
2. Each block contains: test results, quality scores, bugs found, and upgrade proposals.
3. When a proposal (e.g., `AU-001.1`) is approved, the Agent creates a new sub-block and references the old one.
4. The `Evaluation Record` column in [backlog.md Task Status Tracker](backlog.md#task-status-tracker) is linked to the anchor here.

### Bugs / Side Effects Found

| Bug ID | Description   | Severity | Status |
| ------ | ------------- | -------- | ------ |
| —      | No bugs found | —        | —      |

---

### Technical Notes

- **`email:rfc` only** (not `dns`) — live DNS lookup was disabled to prevent test failures in offline/CI environments. This is intentional and documented here. In production, `email:rfc,dns` can be enabled via config if DNS lookups are acceptable.
- **CSRF test (TC-AU001-09)** — tests that `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is registered in the `web` group. A true 419 test would require a real browser session; the class-exists assertion is sufficient to confirm the middleware is not accidentally removed.
- **Mocked Dependencies:**
  - `Event::fake([Registered::class])` — Email verification (dependent on AU-005/mail config) is mocked via Laravel's event system. The `Registered` event is asserted to be dispatched but actual email delivery is not tested here.
  - `Mail::fake()` not needed — email is dispatched via event listener, not directly in the controller.
- **`is_active` column** — added to users table (migration `2026_04_09_052244`) to support AU-006 user suspension (UM-003). Default `true`. Not yet tested here — covered in UM-003.
- **`google_id` column** — added for AU-003 Google OAuth. Default `null`. Not yet tested here.

| AU-001.3    | Add rate limiting to the register endpoint (e.g., 5 attempts/min per IP)       | Prevents registration spam/bots                                          | Low — Laravel `throttle` middleware             |
| AU-001.4    | Return JSON response when request expects `application/json` (API support)     | Enables mobile app integration                                           | Medium — add `wantsJson()` branch in controller |

| Bug ID | Description   | Severity | Status |
| ------ | ------------- | -------- | ------ |
| —      | No bugs found | —        | —      |

---

### Technical Notes

- **`RouteServiceProvider::HOME` updated** from `/home` (non-existent) to `/dashboard`. This affects `RedirectIfAuthenticated` middleware — authenticated users are now correctly redirected to `/dashboard` instead of a 404.
- **`verified` middleware removed** from dashboard route — `email_verified_at` column is not populated by AU-001/AU-002 (email verification is AU-005). Keeping `verified` would block all users post-login until AU-005 is built. Will be re-added when AU-005 is implemented.
- **Session fixation** — `$request->session()->regenerate()` is called on every successful login, generating a new session ID. Verified by TC-AU002-08.
- **Generic error message** — `Auth::attempt()` failure always returns `trans('auth.failed')` regardless of whether the email exists. This prevents user enumeration attacks. Verified by TC-AU002-11.
- **Mocked Dependencies:** None — login has no external dependencies. `Auth::attempt()`, session, and redirect are all in-memory during testing (SQLite + array session driver via `phpunit.xml`).
- **`remember me`** — uses Laravel's built-in `remember_token` column. Verified that token is written to DB when `remember=1`. Long-term cookie behaviour is a browser concern, not tested here.

| AU-002.2    | Add account lockout after N failed attempts (lock `is_active=false` for 15 min) | Stronger brute-force protection                         | Medium — requires failed-attempt counter column |
| AU-002.3    | Return JSON response when `Accept: application/json` header is present          | Enables SPA / mobile app login                          | Low — `wantsJson()` branch                      |
| AU-002.4    | Add login activity log (IP, user-agent, timestamp) to an `audit_logs` table     | Enables security monitoring and suspicious login alerts | Medium — new table + model                      |

- **`email_verified_at` in `$fillable`** — Google has already verified the user's email. Setting `email_verified_at = now()` on auto-registration is correct and intentional. Required adding it to `User::$fillable` (was missing — bug found and fixed by TC-AU003-05).
- **Random password for Google users** — Auto-registered users have a `bcrypt(Str::random(32))` password. This ensures their account has a valid password hash (required by the `password` column) while making it impossible to log in via the password form without a password-reset flow.
- **Socialite mocking pattern** — `Socialite::shouldReceive('driver')->with('google')->andReturn($provider)` via Mockery. This avoids any real HTTP calls to Google during tests.
- **`email:rfc` on registration** — AU-001/AU-002 use `email:rfc` validation. Google users bypass the FormRequest since they arrive via OAuth — Google's own email is trusted.
- **No CSRF check on callback route** — GET `/auth/google/callback` is a public route. Laravel's CSRF protection only applies to POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, so this is correct by design.
- **Linking logic** — Priority: google_id lookup first (fastest), then email lookup as fallback. This ensures users who registered by email first get seamlessly linked on first Google login.

| AU-003.1    | Add `state` parameter validation to the callback route (verify `state` from session)        | Prevents CSRF attacks on the OAuth callback      | Low — Socialite handles this with `->stateless()` or custom state |
| AU-003.2    | Add additional OAuth providers (GitHub, Facebook) using the same `GoogleController` pattern | Expands sign-in options                          | Low — Socialite supports many drivers                             |
| AU-003.3    | Show user-friendly error page instead of a generic redirect when Socialite fails            | Better UX than a flash message on the login page | Low — dedicated `oauth-error` view                                |
| AU-003.4    | Log the OAuth provider and timestamp to `audit_logs` on each login                          | Enables security monitoring                      | Medium — requires `audit_logs` table (also proposed in AU-002.4)  |

| BUG-AU004-01 | `destroy()` redirected to `/login` instead of home page `/` — contradicts AC "Redirects to home page" | Low      | Fixed — changed `redirect()->route('login')` to `redirect('/')` |

---

### Technical Notes

- **Redirect target fix** — The pre-existing `destroy()` method redirected to `/login`. AC requires home (`/`). A one-line change to `redirect('/')` fixed it. No other files changed.
- **CSRF test pattern** — Same as AU-001/AU-002: confirms `VerifyCsrfToken` is registered in the `web` middleware group. Actual 419 is not triggered in unit tests because Laravel's `VerifyCsrfToken::runningUnitTests()` returns `true` — this is a PHP testing environment constraint, not a code defect.
- **Session invalidation** — `$request->session()->invalidate()` + `regenerateToken()` ensures both the session ID and CSRF token are rotated, preventing session fixation after logout.
- **Mocked Dependencies:** None.
- **Architectural Impact:** None. Logout tightens the security boundary — does not conflict with AU-001 (register), AU-002 (login), or AU-003 (Google OAuth). All three login paths are properly terminated by this route.

---

### Technical Notes

- **No email enumeration** — `ForgotPasswordController::store()` always calls `Password::sendResetLink()` and always returns `with('status', __('passwords.sent'))` regardless of whether the email exists. Unknown emails silently no-op (Laravel handles this internally).
- **Token expiry** — Default is 60 minutes (configured in `config/auth.php` under `passwords.users.expire = 60`). This matches AC "Reset link expires in 60 minutes".
- **Password validation** — `min:8` + `confirmed` + `regex:/[A-Z]/` (at least one uppercase) — consistent with AU-001 registration policy.
- **`Notification::fake()`** — Used in TC-AU005-02 and TC-AU005-12 to prevent actual email sending and assert notification dispatch without a real mail server.
- **`Password::createToken($user)`** — Used in tests to generate a real valid token for the reset form submission tests, bypassing the email flow.
- **Mocked Dependencies:** `Notification::fake()` mocks email delivery (AU-005 depends on mail config — mocked per Rule 5).
- **Architectural Impact:** None. Routes are behind `guest` middleware (password reset is only for unauthenticated users). No conflict with AU-001–004.

### Technical Notes

- **Middleware registration** — Spatie v6 uses `Spatie\Permission\Middleware\RoleMiddleware` (path is `src/Middleware/`, not `src/Middlewares/`). Added `role`, `permission`, `role_or_permission` all to `Kernel::$middlewareAliases`.
- **Route group** — `/admin/*` routes use `['auth', 'role:admin']` middleware stack. `auth` resolves first, so a guest gets a 302 redirect to login rather than a 403 (correct UX).
- **Admin seeder** — `RoleSeeder` was already created in a prior task. `DatabaseSeeder` now calls it, so `php artisan db:seed` will create both roles.
- **No privilege escalation risk** — a `role:user` user cannot elevate to `admin` without explicit `assignRole('admin')` — Spatie enforces this at the DB and middleware level.
- **Architectural Impact** — AU-006 adds the `role:admin` middleware guard. This must be applied to all future admin routes (AD-001–004, PM-001–006, UM-001–004, RM-001–003). All existing user routes (AU-001–005) are unaffected.
- **Mocked Dependencies:** None.

     SPRINT 3 — User Profile
     ============================================================ -->

## EVAL-UP-001 · User Profile View/Edit with Avatar

- **Task:** UP-001
- **Sprint:** 3
- **Date:** 2026-04-15
- **Tag:** `v1.0-UP-001-stable`
- **Branch:** `feature/UP-001` → merged to `master`

### STEP 1 — Architecture Review

- Added `avatar` column (nullable string) via migration `add_avatar_to_users_table`
- `User::$fillable` extended with `'avatar'`
- New `ProfileController` (show/update) in `app/Http/Controllers/`
- New `UpdateProfileRequest` with `image|mimes:jpg,jpeg,png|max:2048` rule + `Rule::unique` ignore self
- Two routes (`GET /profile`, `PUT /profile`) added to `auth` middleware group
- New Blade view `resources/views/profile/show.blade.php`
- Avatar files stored in `storage/app/public/avatars/` via `Storage::disk('public')`

### STEP 2 — Security Checklist

- [x] CSRF: `@csrf` + `@method('PUT')` in form, middleware active on route
- [x] XSS: Blade `{{ }}` auto-escapes all output
- [x] Auth: both routes inside `auth` middleware group; guest → redirect to login
- [x] File Upload: `mimes:jpg,jpeg,png`, `max:2048`, `image` rule — no arbitrary file upload
- [x] SQLi: Eloquent ORM + FormRequest validation — no raw queries
- [x] Email unique: `Rule::unique()->ignore($user->id)` prevents false conflict on own email

### STEP 3 — Test Results

| TC    | Description                                        | Type        | Result |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| TC-01 | GET /profile returns 200 + pre-filled data         | Happy       | PASS   |
| TC-02 | PUT /profile valid name/email → DB updated + flash | Happy       | PASS   |
| TC-03 | Avatar jpg upload stores file + DB updated         | Happy       | PASS   |
| TC-04 | Same email → no unique conflict                    | Edge        | PASS   |
| TC-05 | Guest GET /profile → redirect login                | Security    | PASS   |
| TC-06 | Guest PUT /profile → redirect login                | Security    | PASS   |
| TC-07 | CSRF middleware registered on route                | Security    | PASS   |
| TC-08 | Avatar >2MB → validation error                     | Negative    | PASS   |
| TC-09 | Non-image (pdf) avatar → validation error          | Negative    | PASS   |
| TC-10 | Empty name → validation error                      | Negative    | PASS   |
| TC-11 | Duplicate email (other user) → error               | Negative    | PASS   |
| TC-12 | Profile update within 2s                           | Performance | PASS   |

**Score: 12/12 — All acceptance criteria met**

### STEP 4 — Proposals for Next Task

- Consider adding a `change_password` form to the profile page (UP-002 or separate task)
- Avatar deletion feature (remove current avatar) could be a quick win
- Image resizing/thumbnail generation before storage (reduce disk usage)

## EVAL-PC-001 · Product Listing Page with Pagination

- **Task:** PC-001
- **Sprint:** 2
- **Date:** 2026-04-15
- **Tag:** `v1.0-PC-001-stable`
- **Branch:** `feature/PC-001` → merged to `master`

### STEP 1 — Architecture Review

- New `products` table migration: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price` (decimal 10,2), `stock` (uint), `image` (nullable), timestamps
- `Product` model with `$fillable`, `$casts` (`price` → decimal:2, `stock` → integer)
- `ProductFactory` with `outOfStock()` state helper
- `ProductController::index()` — `Product::latest()->paginate(12)` → `products.index` view
- `GET /products` route added as public (no auth middleware)
- Blade view: grid loop with name, price, stock status badge; `{{ $products->links() }}` pagination

### STEP 2 — Security Checklist

- [x] XSS: Blade `{{ }}` escapes product name and all output
- [x] No auth required — public route is intentional per AC
- [x] No mass assignment risk — `$fillable` defined
- [x] No raw SQL — Eloquent paginate()

### STEP 3 — Test Results

| TC    | Description                                   | Type        | Result |

**Score: 12/12 — All acceptance criteria met**

### STEP 4 — Proposals for Next Task

- PC-002 (search) can reuse `ProductController` with a `search()` method or a query scope on `Product`
- Consider adding a `Category` model (belongsToMany) before PC-003 filters
- Image thumbnail generation on upload would improve page-load performance

<!-- EVAL-PC-001 END -->

## EVAL-PC-002 · Product Search by Name and Description

- **Task:** PC-002
- **Sprint:** 2
- **Date:** 2026-04-15
- **Tag:** `v1.0-PC-002-stable`
- **Branch:** `feature/PC-002` → merged to `master`

### STEP 1 — Architecture Review

- `scopeSearch($query, string $term)` added to `Product` model — `LIKE %term%` on `name` OR `description`
- `ProductController::search()` — validates blank query (redirects to index), paginates 12/page with `withQueryString()`
- Route `GET /products/search` added as public (no auth)
- New view `products/search.blade.php` — search form, result count, product grid, "No products found" state, pagination

### STEP 2 — Security Checklist

- [x] XSS: `{{ $q }}` auto-escaped; product fields rendered with `{{ }}`
- [x] SQL injection: Eloquent `LIKE` binding — never raw interpolation
- [x] No auth required — public route per AC
- [x] Query string preserved via `withQueryString()` — no sensitive data leak

### STEP 3 — Test Results

| TC    | Description                                     | Type        | Result |

**Score: 12/12 — All acceptance criteria met**

### STEP 4 — Proposals for Next Task

- PC-003 (filter by category/price/rating) can add `scopeFilter()` on Product; category requires its own model
- Consider debounced JS search-as-you-type for UX improvement (post-MVP)
- Search index (MySQL FULLTEXT) recommended before production for scale

<!-- EVAL-PC-002 END -->

## EVAL-PC-003 · Product Filters by Category, Price Range, Rating

- **Task:** PC-003
- **Sprint:** 2
- **Date:** 2026-04-15
- **Tag:** `v1.0-PC-003-stable`
- **Branch:** `feature/PC-003` → merged to `master`

### STEP 1 — Architecture Review

- `Category` model + migration (`id`, `name` unique, timestamps) introduced; `CategoryFactory` added
- `products` table migrated: `category_id` (nullable FK → nullOnDelete) + `rating` (decimal 3,2 nullable)
- `scopeFilter($query, array $filters)` added to `Product` model — handles `category`, `min_price`, `max_price`, `min_rating`; each condition only applied when value is non-empty
- `ProductController::index()` accepts filter params via `$request->only([...])`, loads `$categories`, applies `Product::filter($filters)->latest()->paginate(12)->withQueryString()`
- Filter form in `products/index.blade.php` — `GET` to `products.index`, category `<select>`, min/max price and min_rating inputs, filter state persisted via `value=` attributes, "Clear Filters" link

### STEP 2 — Security Checklist

- [x] XSS: all filter outputs rendered with `{{ }}` auto-escaping; `<select>` option values from DB integer IDs
- [x] SQL injection: Eloquent parameterised bindings — no raw interpolation in `scopeFilter`
- [x] No auth required — public route per AC
- [x] `withQueryString()` on paginator — filter params persist across pages
- [x] Nullable FK with `nullOnDelete` — no orphan constraint violations when category deleted

### STEP 3 — Test Results

| TC    | Description                                              | Type        | Result |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ |

| TC-02 | Filter by min_price excludes cheaper products            | Happy       | PASS   |
| TC-03 | Filter by max_price excludes expensive products          | Happy       | PASS   |

**Score: 12/12 — All acceptance criteria met**

### STEP 4 — Proposals for Next Task

- PC-004 (product detail page) should display `category.name` and `rating` now that both fields are available
- Consider adding a rating widget (stars) on the detail and listing pages for visual clarity
- Price range slider (JS) would improve UX over plain number inputs post-MVP

<!-- EVAL-PC-003 END -->

## EVAL-PC-004 · Product Sort by Newest, Oldest, Price, Rating

- **Task:** PC-004
- **Sprint:** 2
- **Date:** 2026-04-15
- **Tag:** `v1.0-PC-004-stable`
- **Branch:** `feature/PC-004` → merged to `master`

### STEP 1 — Architecture Review

- `scopeSort($query, string $sort)` added to `Product` model — uses `match` expression; options: `newest` (default), `oldest`, `price_asc`, `price_desc`, `rating`; unknown values fall back to `newest`
- `ProductController::index()` updated: `sort` added to `$request->only([...])`, `$sort` extracted with `?? 'newest'` default; `->latest()` replaced with `->sort($sort)`
- Sort `<select>` dropdown added to filter form in `products/index.blade.php`; selected state persisted from `$filters['sort']`; 5 options rendered

### STEP 2 — Security Checklist

- [x] Unknown sort values fall back to `newest` via `match` default — no raw SQL injection possible
- [x] Sort param rendered in `<select>` via server-side comparison only — no unescaped output
- [x] `withQueryString()` preserves sort across pagination pages
- [x] No auth required — public route per AC

**Score: 12/12 — All acceptance criteria met**

### STEP 4 — Proposals for Next Task

- PC-005 (product detail page) should display category, rating, and allow adding to cart
- Consider persisting default sort preference in session/cookie for returning users (post-MVP)
- A relevance/sales-based sort could be added once order data exists (post-MVP)

<!-- EVAL-PC-004 END -->

## EVAL-PC-005 · Product Detail Page with Slug, SKU, Related Products

- **Task:** PC-005
- **Sprint:** 2
- **Date:** 2026-04-15
- **Tag:** `v1.0-PC-005-stable`
- **Branch:** `feature/PC-005` → merged to `master`

### STEP 1 — Architecture Review

- Migration `add_slug_sku_to_products_table`: adds `slug` (unique, nullable) and `sku` (unique, nullable) to `products`
- `Product` model: `slug` + `sku` added to `$fillable`; `getRouteKeyName()` returns `'slug'` for SEO-friendly URLs; `relatedProducts(int $limit)` method queries same category, excludes self, limits to 4
- `ProductFactory`: `name` made unique with `fake()->unique()->words(3, true)`; `slug = Str::slug($name)`, `sku = strtoupper(fake()->bothify('???-####'))`
- Route `GET /products/{product:slug}` → `products.show` (public, no auth)
- `ProductController::show(Product $product)` — route model binding by slug, loads related products
- `products/show.blade.php` — image, name, SKU, price, category, rating, stock status, description, related products grid, "Add to Cart" placeholder (disabled), `<meta description>` for SEO
- `products/index.blade.php` — product name in listing now links to `products.show`

### STEP 2 — Security Checklist

- [x] Route model binding — invalid slug auto-returns 404 (no information disclosure)
- [x] All product fields rendered with `{{ }}` auto-escaping (XSS safe)
- [x] `<meta description>` uses `Str::limit()` — description truncated, never raw user input in meta length
- [x] No auth required per AC (visitor feature)
- [x] SKU/slug uniqueness enforced at DB level

### STEP 3 — Test Results

| TC    | Description                                                | Type          | Result |

**Score: 12/12 — All acceptance criteria met**

### Architecture Notes

- Cart stored as `session('cart')` keyed by `product_id` (integer): `['product_id', 'name', 'price', 'quantity', 'slug']`
- Session survives login: Laravel's `session()->regenerate()` preserves data, so guest cart is automatically available after auth (AC satisfied)
- `CartController::store()` returns `JsonResponse` when `$request->expectsJson()`, `RedirectResponse` otherwise — dual-mode, no duplication
- Quantity merges on re-add; total capped at current stock

### STEP 4 — Proposals for Next Task

- **SC-002 (View Cart)** — `GET /cart` → `CartController::index()` returning `cart.index` view; list items with image, name, qty, unit price, subtotal, order total; empty-cart state
- Consider extracting a `CartService` when SC-002/SC-003 are built (currently thin enough to stay in controller)
- Cart badge in a shared layout/nav (currently local to product detail page) should be addressed in SC-002 sprint

### STEP 4 — Proposals for Next Task

- **SC-003 (Update Cart Qty)** — `PATCH /cart/{productId}` → `CartController::update()`; qty bounded 1–stock; redirect to cart view
- **SC-004 (Remove from Cart)** — `DELETE /cart/{productId}` → `CartController::destroy()`; can be batched with SC-003 (same sprint)
- Consider moving total calculation into a helper/service once SC-003 lands (total will be reused across update/view)

## EVAL-CP-002 — Checkout Shipping Method (Standard/Express, cost in session)

**Story:** CP-002 · Sprint 3 · Checkout & Payment Epic

### STEP 1 — Code

**New / modified files:**

| File                                          | Change                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/Http/Controllers/CheckoutController.php` | Added `SHIPPING_OPTIONS` const, `showShipping()`, `storeShipping()`                                                                       |
| `routes/web.php`                              | Replaced placeholder `GET /checkout/shipping` with real routes; added `POST /checkout/shipping`; added `GET /checkout/review` placeholder |
| `resources/views/checkout/shipping.blade.php` | NEW — radio option list, order subtotal + shipping cost + grand total display, live JS totals                                             |
| `tests/Feature/CheckoutShippingTest.php`      | NEW — 12 tests                                                                                                                            |

**Key implementation decisions:**

- Shipping options defined as `private const SHIPPING_OPTIONS` on the controller — avoids a DB table for two static options
- `showShipping()` guards the session: no `checkout.address` → redirect back to address step
- `storeShipping()` validates `method` against `array_keys(SHIPPING_OPTIONS)` — adding a third option only requires one edit
- Session key: `checkout.shipping` stores `{method, label, cost}`
- Live JS in the view updates shipping cost + grand total on radio change; no server round-trip needed

### STEP 4 — Proposals for Next Task

- **CP-003 (Payment Gateway)** — `GET/POST /checkout/review` → show order summary (address + shipping + cart); integrate Stripe or Midtrans for payment; create `orders` and `order_items` tables on success
- Replace the `checkout.review` placeholder route with the full CP-003 implementation

**Key implementation decisions:**

- `PaymentServiceInterface` abstraction makes `StripePaymentService` fully mockable in tests — no real Stripe calls during CI
- Card data never transmitted to Laravel server: Stripe.js tokenizes in-browser, only `PaymentMethod` ID reaches the server
- Webhook route placed outside auth/CSRF middleware groups; signature verified via `Webhook::constructEvent()` before any DB write
- `Order` status machine: `pending` → `paid` (on `payment_intent.succeeded`) or `failed` (on `payment_intent.payment_failed`)
- `OrderItem` stores product snapshot (name + price at time of purchase) to survive future catalog changes

### STEP 4 — Proposals for Next Task

- **CP-004 (Order Confirmation Email)** — After `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook, send confirmation email to user with order summary
- **CP-005 (Success/Failure Page)** — Stripe redirects to `/checkout/success?payment_intent=...`; query PaymentIntent status and show appropriate page
