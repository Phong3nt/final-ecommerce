# Evaluation History — Laravel E-Commerce

**Project:** Laravel E-Commerce Platform  
**Purpose:** Record code quality evaluations, test results, bugs, and improvement proposals for every completed task.  
**References:** [backlog.md](backlog.md) · [testing_standards.md](testing_standards.md) · [instruction.md](instruction.md)

---

## How to Use This File

1. **After completing a task**, the Agent appends a new `## EVAL-<TaskID>` block below.
2. Each block contains: test results, quality scores, bugs found, and upgrade proposals.
3. When a proposal (e.g., `AU-001.1`) is approved, the Agent creates a new sub-block and references the old one.
4. The `Evaluation Record` column in [backlog.md Task Status Tracker](backlog.md#task-status-tracker) is linked to the anchor here.

### Bugs / Side Effects Found

| Bug ID | Description   | Severity | Status |
| ------ | ------------- | -------- | ------ |
| —      | No bugs found | —        | —      |

---

### Technical Notes

- **`email:rfc` only** (not `dns`) — live DNS lookup was disabled to prevent test failures in offline/CI environments. This is intentional and documented here. In production, `email:rfc,dns` can be enabled via config if DNS lookups are acceptable.
- **CSRF test (TC-AU001-09)** — tests that `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is registered in the `web` group. A true 419 test would require a real browser session; the class-exists assertion is sufficient to confirm the middleware is not accidentally removed.
- **Mocked Dependencies:**
  - `Event::fake([Registered::class])` — Email verification (dependent on AU-005/mail config) is mocked via Laravel's event system. The `Registered` event is asserted to be dispatched but actual email delivery is not tested here.
  - `Mail::fake()` not needed — email is dispatched via event listener, not directly in the controller.
- **`is_active` column** — added to users table (migration `2026_04_09_052244`) to support AU-006 user suspension (UM-003). Default `true`. Not yet tested here — covered in UM-003.
- **`google_id` column** — added for AU-003 Google OAuth. Default `null`. Not yet tested here.

| AU-001.3    | Add rate limiting to the register endpoint (e.g., 5 attempts/min per IP)       | Prevents registration spam/bots                                          | Low — Laravel `throttle` middleware             |
| AU-001.4    | Return JSON response when request expects `application/json` (API support)     | Enables mobile app integration                                           | Medium — add `wantsJson()` branch in controller |

| Bug ID | Description   | Severity | Status |
| ------ | ------------- | -------- | ------ |
| —      | No bugs found | —        | —      |

---

### Technical Notes

- **`RouteServiceProvider::HOME` updated** from `/home` (non-existent) to `/dashboard`. This affects `RedirectIfAuthenticated` middleware — authenticated users are now correctly redirected to `/dashboard` instead of a 404.
- **`verified` middleware removed** from dashboard route — `email_verified_at` column is not populated by AU-001/AU-002 (email verification is AU-005). Keeping `verified` would block all users post-login until AU-005 is built. Will be re-added when AU-005 is implemented.
- **Session fixation** — `$request->session()->regenerate()` is called on every successful login, generating a new session ID. Verified by TC-AU002-08.
- **Generic error message** — `Auth::attempt()` failure always returns `trans('auth.failed')` regardless of whether the email exists. This prevents user enumeration attacks. Verified by TC-AU002-11.
- **Mocked Dependencies:** None — login has no external dependencies. `Auth::attempt()`, session, and redirect are all in-memory during testing (SQLite + array session driver via `phpunit.xml`).
- **`remember me`** — uses Laravel's built-in `remember_token` column. Verified that token is written to DB when `remember=1`. Long-term cookie behaviour is a browser concern, not tested here.

| AU-002.2    | Add account lockout after N failed attempts (lock `is_active=false` for 15 min) | Stronger brute-force protection                         | Medium — requires failed-attempt counter column |
| AU-002.3    | Return JSON response when `Accept: application/json` header is present          | Enables SPA / mobile app login                          | Low — `wantsJson()` branch                      |
| AU-002.4    | Add login activity log (IP, user-agent, timestamp) to an `audit_logs` table     | Enables security monitoring and suspicious login alerts | Medium — new table + model                      |

- **`email_verified_at` in `$fillable`** — Google has already verified the user's email. Setting `email_verified_at = now()` on auto-registration is correct and intentional. Required adding it to `User::$fillable` (was missing — bug found and fixed by TC-AU003-05).
- **Random password for Google users** — Auto-registered users have a `bcrypt(Str::random(32))` password. This ensures their account has a valid password hash (required by the `password` column) while making it impossible to log in via the password form without a password-reset flow.
- **Socialite mocking pattern** — `Socialite::shouldReceive('driver')->with('google')->andReturn($provider)` via Mockery. This avoids any real HTTP calls to Google during tests.
- **`email:rfc` on registration** — AU-001/AU-002 use `email:rfc` validation. Google users bypass the FormRequest since they arrive via OAuth — Google's own email is trusted.
- **No CSRF check on callback route** — GET `/auth/google/callback` is a public route. Laravel's CSRF protection only applies to POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, so this is correct by design.
- **Linking logic** — Priority: google_id lookup first (fastest), then email lookup as fallback. This ensures users who registered by email first get seamlessly linked on first Google login.

| AU-003.1    | Add `state` parameter validation to the callback route (verify `state` from session)        | Prevents CSRF attacks on the OAuth callback      | Low — Socialite handles this with `->stateless()` or custom state |
| AU-003.2    | Add additional OAuth providers (GitHub, Facebook) using the same `GoogleController` pattern | Expands sign-in options                          | Low — Socialite supports many drivers                             |
| AU-003.3    | Show user-friendly error page instead of a generic redirect when Socialite fails            | Better UX than a flash message on the login page | Low — dedicated `oauth-error` view                                |
| AU-003.4    | Log the OAuth provider and timestamp to `audit_logs` on each login                          | Enables security monitoring                      | Medium — requires `audit_logs` table (also proposed in AU-002.4)  |

| BUG-AU004-01 | `destroy()` redirected to `/login` instead of home page `/` — contradicts AC "Redirects to home page" | Low      | Fixed — changed `redirect()->route('login')` to `redirect('/')` |

---

### Technical Notes

- **Redirect target fix** — The pre-existing `destroy()` method redirected to `/login`. AC requires home (`/`). A one-line change to `redirect('/')` fixed it. No other files changed.
- **CSRF test pattern** — Same as AU-001/AU-002: confirms `VerifyCsrfToken` is registered in the `web` middleware group. Actual 419 is not triggered in unit tests because Laravel's `VerifyCsrfToken::runningUnitTests()` returns `true` — this is a PHP testing environment constraint, not a code defect.
- **Session invalidation** — `$request->session()->invalidate()` + `regenerateToken()` ensures both the session ID and CSRF token are rotated, preventing session fixation after logout.
- **Mocked Dependencies:** None.
- **Architectural Impact:** None. Logout tightens the security boundary — does not conflict with AU-001 (register), AU-002 (login), or AU-003 (Google OAuth). All three login paths are properly terminated by this route.

---

### Technical Notes

- **No email enumeration** — `ForgotPasswordController::store()` always calls `Password::sendResetLink()` and always returns `with('status', __('passwords.sent'))` regardless of whether the email exists. Unknown emails silently no-op (Laravel handles this internally).
- **Token expiry** — Default is 60 minutes (configured in `config/auth.php` under `passwords.users.expire = 60`). This matches AC "Reset link expires in 60 minutes".
- **Password validation** — `min:8` + `confirmed` + `regex:/[A-Z]/` (at least one uppercase) — consistent with AU-001 registration policy.
- **`Notification::fake()`** — Used in TC-AU005-02 and TC-AU005-12 to prevent actual email sending and assert notification dispatch without a real mail server.
- **`Password::createToken($user)`** — Used in tests to generate a real valid token for the reset form submission tests, bypassing the email flow.
- **Mocked Dependencies:** `Notification::fake()` mocks email delivery (AU-005 depends on mail config — mocked per Rule 5).
- **Architectural Impact:** None. Routes are behind `guest` middleware (password reset is only for unauthenticated users). No conflict with AU-001–004.

### Technical Notes

- **Middleware registration** — Spatie v6 uses `Spatie\Permission\Middleware\RoleMiddleware` (path is `src/Middleware/`, not `src/Middlewares/`). Added `role`, `permission`, `role_or_permission` all to `Kernel::$middlewareAliases`.
- **Route group** — `/admin/*` routes use `['auth', 'role:admin']` middleware stack. `auth` resolves first, so a guest gets a 302 redirect to login rather than a 403 (correct UX).
- **Admin seeder** — `RoleSeeder` was already created in a prior task. `DatabaseSeeder` now calls it, so `php artisan db:seed` will create both roles.
- **No privilege escalation risk** — a `role:user` user cannot elevate to `admin` without explicit `assignRole('admin')` — Spatie enforces this at the DB and middleware level.
- **Architectural Impact** — AU-006 adds the `role:admin` middleware guard. This must be applied to all future admin routes (AD-001–004, PM-001–006, UM-001–004, RM-001–003). All existing user routes (AU-001–005) are unaffected.
- **Mocked Dependencies:** None.

     SPRINT 3 — User Profile
     ============================================================ -->

## EVAL-UP-001 · User Profile View/Edit with Avatar

- **Task:** UP-001
- **Sprint:** 3
- **Date:** 2026-04-15
- **Tag:** `v1.0-UP-001-stable`
- **Branch:** `feature/UP-001` → merged to `master`

### STEP 1 — Architecture Review

- Added `avatar` column (nullable string) via migration `add_avatar_to_users_table`
- `User::$fillable` extended with `'avatar'`
- New `ProfileController` (show/update) in `app/Http/Controllers/`
- New `UpdateProfileRequest` with `image|mimes:jpg,jpeg,png|max:2048` rule + `Rule::unique` ignore self
- Two routes (`GET /profile`, `PUT /profile`) added to `auth` middleware group
- New Blade view `resources/views/profile/show.blade.php`
- Avatar files stored in `storage/app/public/avatars/` via `Storage::disk('public')`

### STEP 2 — Security Checklist

- [x] CSRF: `@csrf` + `@method('PUT')` in form, middleware active on route
- [x] XSS: Blade `{{ }}` auto-escapes all output
- [x] Auth: both routes inside `auth` middleware group; guest → redirect to login
- [x] File Upload: `mimes:jpg,jpeg,png`, `max:2048`, `image` rule — no arbitrary file upload
- [x] SQLi: Eloquent ORM + FormRequest validation — no raw queries
- [x] Email unique: `Rule::unique()->ignore($user->id)` prevents false conflict on own email

### STEP 3 — Test Results

| TC    | Description                                        | Type        | Result |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| TC-01 | GET /profile returns 200 + pre-filled data         | Happy       | PASS   |
| TC-02 | PUT /profile valid name/email → DB updated + flash | Happy       | PASS   |
| TC-03 | Avatar jpg upload stores file + DB updated         | Happy       | PASS   |
| TC-04 | Same email → no unique conflict                    | Edge        | PASS   |
| TC-05 | Guest GET /profile → redirect login                | Security    | PASS   |
| TC-06 | Guest PUT /profile → redirect login                | Security    | PASS   |
| TC-07 | CSRF middleware registered on route                | Security    | PASS   |
| TC-08 | Avatar >2MB → validation error                     | Negative    | PASS   |
| TC-09 | Non-image (pdf) avatar → validation error          | Negative    | PASS   |
| TC-10 | Empty name → validation error                      | Negative    | PASS   |
| TC-11 | Duplicate email (other user) → error               | Negative    | PASS   |
| TC-12 | Profile update within 2s                           | Performance | PASS   |

**Score: 12/12 — All acceptance criteria met**

### STEP 4 — Proposals for Next Task

- Consider adding a `change_password` form to the profile page (UP-002 or separate task)
- Avatar deletion feature (remove current avatar) could be a quick win
- Image resizing/thumbnail generation before storage (reduce disk usage)

## EVAL-PC-001 · Product Listing Page with Pagination

- **Task:** PC-001
- **Sprint:** 2
- **Date:** 2026-04-15
- **Tag:** `v1.0-PC-001-stable`
- **Branch:** `feature/PC-001` → merged to `master`

### STEP 1 — Architecture Review

- New `products` table migration: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price` (decimal 10,2), `stock` (uint), `image` (nullable), timestamps
- `Product` model with `$fillable`, `$casts` (`price` → decimal:2, `stock` → integer)
- `ProductFactory` with `outOfStock()` state helper
- `ProductController::index()` — `Product::latest()->paginate(12)` → `products.index` view
- `GET /products` route added as public (no auth middleware)
- Blade view: grid loop with name, price, stock status badge; `{{ $products->links() }}` pagination

### STEP 2 — Security Checklist

- [x] XSS: Blade `{{ }}` escapes product name and all output
- [x] No auth required — public route is intentional per AC
- [x] No mass assignment risk — `$fillable` defined
- [x] No raw SQL — Eloquent paginate()

### STEP 3 — Test Results

| TC    | Description                                   | Type        | Result |

**Score: 12/12 — All acceptance criteria met**

### STEP 4 — Proposals for Next Task

- PC-002 (search) can reuse `ProductController` with a `search()` method or a query scope on `Product`
- Consider adding a `Category` model (belongsToMany) before PC-003 filters
- Image thumbnail generation on upload would improve page-load performance

<!-- EVAL-PC-001 END -->

## EVAL-PC-002 · Product Search by Name and Description

- **Task:** PC-002
- **Sprint:** 2
- **Date:** 2026-04-15
- **Tag:** `v1.0-PC-002-stable`
- **Branch:** `feature/PC-002` → merged to `master`

### STEP 1 — Architecture Review

- `scopeSearch($query, string $term)` added to `Product` model — `LIKE %term%` on `name` OR `description`
- `ProductController::search()` — validates blank query (redirects to index), paginates 12/page with `withQueryString()`
- Route `GET /products/search` added as public (no auth)
- New view `products/search.blade.php` — search form, result count, product grid, "No products found" state, pagination

### STEP 2 — Security Checklist

- [x] XSS: `{{ $q }}` auto-escaped; product fields rendered with `{{ }}`
- [x] SQL injection: Eloquent `LIKE` binding — never raw interpolation
- [x] No auth required — public route per AC
- [x] Query string preserved via `withQueryString()` — no sensitive data leak

### STEP 3 — Test Results

| TC    | Description                                     | Type        | Result |

**Score: 12/12 — All acceptance criteria met**

### STEP 4 — Proposals for Next Task

- PC-003 (filter by category/price/rating) can add `scopeFilter()` on Product; category requires its own model
- Consider debounced JS search-as-you-type for UX improvement (post-MVP)
- Search index (MySQL FULLTEXT) recommended before production for scale

<!-- EVAL-PC-002 END -->

## EVAL-PC-003 · Product Filters by Category, Price Range, Rating

- **Task:** PC-003
- **Sprint:** 2
- **Date:** 2026-04-15
- **Tag:** `v1.0-PC-003-stable`
- **Branch:** `feature/PC-003` → merged to `master`

### STEP 1 — Architecture Review

- `Category` model + migration (`id`, `name` unique, timestamps) introduced; `CategoryFactory` added
- `products` table migrated: `category_id` (nullable FK → nullOnDelete) + `rating` (decimal 3,2 nullable)
- `scopeFilter($query, array $filters)` added to `Product` model — handles `category`, `min_price`, `max_price`, `min_rating`; each condition only applied when value is non-empty
- `ProductController::index()` accepts filter params via `$request->only([...])`, loads `$categories`, applies `Product::filter($filters)->latest()->paginate(12)->withQueryString()`
- Filter form in `products/index.blade.php` — `GET` to `products.index`, category `<select>`, min/max price and min_rating inputs, filter state persisted via `value=` attributes, "Clear Filters" link

### STEP 2 — Security Checklist

- [x] XSS: all filter outputs rendered with `{{ }}` auto-escaping; `<select>` option values from DB integer IDs
- [x] SQL injection: Eloquent parameterised bindings — no raw interpolation in `scopeFilter`
- [x] No auth required — public route per AC
- [x] `withQueryString()` on paginator — filter params persist across pages
- [x] Nullable FK with `nullOnDelete` — no orphan constraint violations when category deleted

### STEP 3 — Test Results

| TC    | Description                                              | Type        | Result |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ |

| TC-02 | Filter by min_price excludes cheaper products            | Happy       | PASS   |
| TC-03 | Filter by max_price excludes expensive products          | Happy       | PASS   |

**Score: 12/12 — All acceptance criteria met**

### STEP 4 — Proposals for Next Task

- PC-004 (product detail page) should display `category.name` and `rating` now that both fields are available
- Consider adding a rating widget (stars) on the detail and listing pages for visual clarity
- Price range slider (JS) would improve UX over plain number inputs post-MVP

<!-- EVAL-PC-003 END -->

## EVAL-PC-004 · Product Sort by Newest, Oldest, Price, Rating

- **Task:** PC-004
- **Sprint:** 2
- **Date:** 2026-04-15
- **Tag:** `v1.0-PC-004-stable`
- **Branch:** `feature/PC-004` → merged to `master`

### STEP 1 — Architecture Review

- `scopeSort($query, string $sort)` added to `Product` model — uses `match` expression; options: `newest` (default), `oldest`, `price_asc`, `price_desc`, `rating`; unknown values fall back to `newest`
- `ProductController::index()` updated: `sort` added to `$request->only([...])`, `$sort` extracted with `?? 'newest'` default; `->latest()` replaced with `->sort($sort)`
- Sort `<select>` dropdown added to filter form in `products/index.blade.php`; selected state persisted from `$filters['sort']`; 5 options rendered

### STEP 2 — Security Checklist

- [x] Unknown sort values fall back to `newest` via `match` default — no raw SQL injection possible
- [x] Sort param rendered in `<select>` via server-side comparison only — no unescaped output
- [x] `withQueryString()` preserves sort across pagination pages
- [x] No auth required — public route per AC

**Score: 12/12 — All acceptance criteria met**

### STEP 4 — Proposals for Next Task

- PC-005 (product detail page) should display category, rating, and allow adding to cart
- Consider persisting default sort preference in session/cookie for returning users (post-MVP)
- A relevance/sales-based sort could be added once order data exists (post-MVP)

<!-- EVAL-PC-004 END -->

## EVAL-PC-005 · Product Detail Page with Slug, SKU, Related Products

- **Task:** PC-005
- **Sprint:** 2
- **Date:** 2026-04-15
- **Tag:** `v1.0-PC-005-stable`
- **Branch:** `feature/PC-005` → merged to `master`

### STEP 1 — Architecture Review

- Migration `add_slug_sku_to_products_table`: adds `slug` (unique, nullable) and `sku` (unique, nullable) to `products`
- `Product` model: `slug` + `sku` added to `$fillable`; `getRouteKeyName()` returns `'slug'` for SEO-friendly URLs; `relatedProducts(int $limit)` method queries same category, excludes self, limits to 4
- `ProductFactory`: `name` made unique with `fake()->unique()->words(3, true)`; `slug = Str::slug($name)`, `sku = strtoupper(fake()->bothify('???-####'))`
- Route `GET /products/{product:slug}` → `products.show` (public, no auth)
- `ProductController::show(Product $product)` — route model binding by slug, loads related products
- `products/show.blade.php` — image, name, SKU, price, category, rating, stock status, description, related products grid, "Add to Cart" placeholder (disabled), `<meta description>` for SEO
- `products/index.blade.php` — product name in listing now links to `products.show`

### STEP 2 — Security Checklist

- [x] Route model binding — invalid slug auto-returns 404 (no information disclosure)
- [x] All product fields rendered with `{{ }}` auto-escaping (XSS safe)
- [x] `<meta description>` uses `Str::limit()` — description truncated, never raw user input in meta length
- [x] No auth required per AC (visitor feature)
- [x] SKU/slug uniqueness enforced at DB level

### STEP 3 — Test Results

| TC    | Description                                                | Type          | Result |

**Score: 12/12 — All acceptance criteria met**

### Architecture Notes

- Cart stored as `session('cart')` keyed by `product_id` (integer): `['product_id', 'name', 'price', 'quantity', 'slug']`
- Session survives login: Laravel's `session()->regenerate()` preserves data, so guest cart is automatically available after auth (AC satisfied)
- `CartController::store()` returns `JsonResponse` when `$request->expectsJson()`, `RedirectResponse` otherwise — dual-mode, no duplication
- Quantity merges on re-add; total capped at current stock

### STEP 4 — Proposals for Next Task

- **SC-002 (View Cart)** — `GET /cart` → `CartController::index()` returning `cart.index` view; list items with image, name, qty, unit price, subtotal, order total; empty-cart state
- Consider extracting a `CartService` when SC-002/SC-003 are built (currently thin enough to stay in controller)
- Cart badge in a shared layout/nav (currently local to product detail page) should be addressed in SC-002 sprint

### STEP 4 — Proposals for Next Task

- **SC-003 (Update Cart Qty)** — `PATCH /cart/{productId}` → `CartController::update()`; qty bounded 1–stock; redirect to cart view
- **SC-004 (Remove from Cart)** — `DELETE /cart/{productId}` → `CartController::destroy()`; can be batched with SC-003 (same sprint)
- Consider moving total calculation into a helper/service once SC-003 lands (total will be reused across update/view)

## EVAL-CP-002 — Checkout Shipping Method (Standard/Express, cost in session)

**Story:** CP-002 · Sprint 3 · Checkout & Payment Epic

### STEP 1 — Code

**New / modified files:**

| File                                          | Change                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/Http/Controllers/CheckoutController.php` | Added `SHIPPING_OPTIONS` const, `showShipping()`, `storeShipping()`                                                                       |
| `routes/web.php`                              | Replaced placeholder `GET /checkout/shipping` with real routes; added `POST /checkout/shipping`; added `GET /checkout/review` placeholder |
| `resources/views/checkout/shipping.blade.php` | NEW — radio option list, order subtotal + shipping cost + grand total display, live JS totals                                             |
| `tests/Feature/CheckoutShippingTest.php`      | NEW — 12 tests                                                                                                                            |

**Key implementation decisions:**

- Shipping options defined as `private const SHIPPING_OPTIONS` on the controller — avoids a DB table for two static options
- `showShipping()` guards the session: no `checkout.address` → redirect back to address step
- `storeShipping()` validates `method` against `array_keys(SHIPPING_OPTIONS)` — adding a third option only requires one edit
- Session key: `checkout.shipping` stores `{method, label, cost}`
- Live JS in the view updates shipping cost + grand total on radio change; no server round-trip needed

## EVAL-CP-003 — Payment Gateway (Stripe PaymentIntent, webhook, tokenization)

**Story:** CP-003 · Sprint 3 · Checkout & Payment Epic

### STEP 1 — Code

**New / modified files:**

| File                                             | Change                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/Http/Controllers/CheckoutController.php`    | Added constructor injection of `PaymentServiceInterface`; added `showReview()`, `placeOrder()`, `handleWebhook()` |
| `app/Models/Order.php`                           | NEW — `status` enum (pending/paid/failed/cancelled), JSON `address` cast, Stripe intent fields                    |

| `app/Services/PaymentServiceInterface.php`       | NEW — `createPaymentIntent()` + `constructWebhookEvent()` contract                                                |
| `app/Services/StripePaymentService.php`          | NEW — Stripe SDK v20 implementation; `StripeClient` injected via container                                        |

| `config/services.php`                            | Added `stripe` block (key/secret/webhook_secret from env)                                                         |
| `phpunit.xml`                                    | Added fake `STRIPE_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env vars for test isolation                     |
| `database/migrations/…_create_orders_table`      | NEW — orders schema with Stripe intent fields                                                                     |
| `database/migrations/…_create_order_items_table` | NEW — order items with product snapshot                                                                           |
| `resources/views/checkout/review.blade.php`      | NEW — order summary, Stripe.js v3, card tokenization, `confirmPayment()` AJAX flow                                |
| `routes/web.php`                                 | Added `GET/POST /checkout/review`, `GET /checkout/success`, public `POST /webhook/stripe` (CSRF-exempt)           |
| `tests/Feature/CheckoutReviewTest.php`           | NEW — 12 tests                                                                                                    |

**Key implementation decisions:**

- `PaymentServiceInterface` abstraction makes `StripePaymentService` fully mockable in tests — no real Stripe calls during CI
- Card data never transmitted to Laravel server: Stripe.js tokenizes in-browser, only `PaymentMethod` ID reaches the server
- Webhook route placed outside auth/CSRF middleware groups; signature verified via `Webhook::constructEvent()` before any DB write
- `Order` status machine: `pending` → `paid` (on `payment_intent.succeeded`) or `failed` (on `payment_intent.payment_failed`)
- `OrderItem` stores product snapshot (name + price at time of purchase) to survive future catalog changes

## EVAL-CP-004 — Order Confirmation Email (Queued Job, Mailable)

**Story:** CP-004 · Sprint 3 · Checkout & Payment Epic

### STEP 1 — Code

**New / modified files:**

| File                                                | Change                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/Mail/OrderConfirmation.php`                    | NEW — `Mailable`; subject `Order Confirmation #<id>`; renders `mail.order-confirmation` with order + delivery |
| `app/Jobs/SendOrderConfirmationEmail.php`           | NEW — `ShouldQueue` job; eager-loads `user` + `items`; dispatches `OrderConfirmation` mailable                |
| `resources/views/mail/order-confirmation.blade.php` | NEW — HTML email: user greeting, order ID, items table, subtotal/shipping/total, estimated delivery, address  |
| `app/Http/Controllers/CheckoutController.php`       | Modified `handleWebhook()` — after status=paid, dispatches `SendOrderConfirmationEmail::dispatch($order)`     |
| `tests/Feature/OrderConfirmationEmailTest.php`      | NEW — 12 tests                                                                                                |

**Key implementation decisions:**

- `SendOrderConfirmationEmail` implements `ShouldQueue` — the job is dispatched asynchronously; with a queue worker running, delivery occurs within seconds of webhook receipt (well within the 1-minute AC)
- Mailable uses `SerializesModels` + `loadMissing(['user','items'])` in `handle()` — safe for queue serialization; no stale eager loads
- Estimated delivery is derived at send-time from `$order->shipping_method` via a private static map in the Mailable — no new DB column needed
- `Mail::fake()` / `Queue::fake()` used for all test assertions — no real SMTP or queue calls during CI

### STEP 2 — Tests (OrderConfirmationEmailTest.php — 12/12 PASS)

## EVAL-CP-005 — Success/Failure Page (Stripe redirect, order summary, retry)

**Story:** CP-005 · Sprint 3 · Checkout & Payment Epic

**New / modified files:**

| File                                          | Change                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/Http/Controllers/CheckoutController.php` | Added `showSuccess()` — reads `?payment_intent` + `?redirect_status` from Stripe redirect; scopes order lookup to `auth()->id()`; clears checkout session on success |
| `routes/web.php`                              | Replaced `checkout.success` placeholder closure with `[CheckoutController::class, 'showSuccess']`                                                                    |

| `resources/views/checkout/failed.blade.php`   | NEW — shows failure reason (`$status`), retry CTA linking back to `checkout.review`                                                                                  |

**Key implementation decisions:**

- `showSuccess()` uses `?payment_intent` from Stripe’s return URL rather than trusting session — the PaymentIntent ID is the authoritative record
- Order lookup is scoped `->where('user_id', auth()->id())` to prevent IDOR: one user cannot view another user’s order summary by guessing an intent ID
- Checkout session (`checkout.address`, `checkout.shipping`, `cart`) is cleared only on `redirect_status === 'succeeded'` — left intact on failure so the user can retry without re-entering details
- A missing or unknown `payment_intent` silently redirects to `checkout.address` (no information leakage)
- Failed page receives `$status` from Stripe (e.g. `requires_payment_method`) and displays a human-readable reason with a retry link

### STEP 2 — Audit Findings

**Approach:** Three-angle verification — (1) middleware registration, (2) route-level exclusion policy, (3) view-level `@csrf` token rendering.

**Finding:** All POST forms in the application already contained `@csrf` directives. No production code changes were required. Laravel's `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is registered in the `web` group, the `$except` array is empty (only the Stripe webhook uses route-level `withoutMiddleware` exclusion, which is correct), and every form view renders a hidden `_token` field.

**Note on test strategy:** Laravel's `VerifyCsrfToken::handle()` calls `runningUnitTests()` which returns `true` when `APP_ENV=testing`, meaning CSRF is bypassed in the test environment. Direct 419 response testing is not viable via this path. The audit relies on view-level assertion (`assertSee('name="_token"', false)`) to confirm `@csrf` renders correctly.

| View                             | Form Type                       | Has `@csrf`            |

---

### STEP 2 — Implementation

**File modified:** `ecommerce/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`

Added `URL::forceScheme('https')` inside `boot()`, gated on `$this->app->environment('production')`:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\URL;

public function boot(): void
{
    if ($this->app->environment('production')) {
        URL::forceScheme('https');
    }
}
```

This ensures:

- All URL generation (named routes, `URL::to()`, `asset()`, redirect URLs) uses `https://` in production
- Local, staging, and testing environments are unaffected (no scheme override)
- Zero changes to routes, controllers, or views — purely a provider-level concern

### STEP 2 — Audit Findings

**Approach:** Two-angle verification — (1) Kernel alias registration for all three Spatie middleware, (2) route-level audit that every route under the `admin/` prefix carries both `auth` and `role:admin` middleware, plus HTTP-level 200/403/redirect assertions.

**Finding:** All admin routes correctly have `['auth', 'role:admin']` applied via a shared group in `routes/web.php`. The Spatie `role`, `permission`, and `role_or_permission` aliases are all registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`. No admin route was found missing either middleware.

| Check                                         | Finding                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `role` alias registered                       | ✅ → `Spatie\Permission\Middleware\RoleMiddleware`             |
| `permission` alias registered                 | ✅ → `Spatie\Permission\Middleware\PermissionMiddleware`       |
| `role_or_permission` alias registered         | ✅ → `Spatie\Permission\Middleware\RoleOrPermissionMiddleware` |
| All `admin/*` routes have `auth`              | ✅                                                             |
| All `admin/*` routes have `role:admin`        | ✅                                                             |
| All `admin/*` routes use `admin.` name prefix | ✅                                                             |

---

### STEP 2 — Implementation

**File modified:** `ecommerce/routes/web.php`

Added `->middleware('throttle:10,1')` to the three auth POST routes inside the `guest` middleware group:

```php
Route::post('/login', [LoginController::class, 'store'])
    ->middleware('throttle:10,1')->name('login.store');

Route::post('/register', [RegisterController::class, 'store'])
    ->middleware('throttle:10,1')->name('register.store');

Route::post('/forgot-password', [ForgotPasswordController::class, 'store'])
    ->middleware('throttle:10,1')->name('password.email');
```

**Limit:** 10 attempts per minute per IP. After 10 requests the server returns HTTP 429 Too Many Requests automatically via Laravel’s `ThrottleRequests` middleware.

**Scope:** Only POST routes are throttled. GET (show-form) routes are left untouched — they carry no sensitive mutation risk and must remain accessible for normal browsing.

**Requirement:** All user inputs sanitized; no raw SQL (use Eloquent/Query Builder).

---

### STEP 1 — Production Code Audit

**Controllers audited (no raw SQL found in any):**

- `CartController`, `CheckoutController`, `HomeController`, `OrderController`
- `ProfileController`, `ProductController`, `Admin/*Controller`
- Zero `DB::statement`, `DB::select`, `DB::insert`, `DB::update`, `DB::delete` calls
- Zero `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_REQUEST` superglobal accesses

**Models audited:**

| Model         | Has `$fillable` | Guarded open (`['*']`) |
| ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| `User`        | ✅ Yes          | ❌ No                  |
| `Product`     | ✅ Yes          | ❌ No                  |
| `Order`       | ✅ Yes          | ❌ No                  |
| `OrderItem`   | ✅ Yes          | ❌ No                  |
| `UserAddress` | ✅ Yes          | ❌ No                  |
| `Category`    | ✅ Yes          | ❌ No                  |

**Query binding verification (`Product.php`):**

- `scopeSearch`: uses `where('name', 'like', '%'.$term.'%')` — PDO binds `%term%` as a bound parameter, never raw interpolation.
- `scopeFilter`: casts `category_id` to `(int)`, price/rating bounds to `(float)` before binding — additional type safety layer.

**Verdict:** Codebase was already fully compliant. No production code changes required.

**Sprint:** 3
**Date:** 2026-04-16
**Branch:** `feature/NF-003` → `master`
**Tag:** `v1.0-NF-003-stable`
**Requirement:** Payment data never stored server-side; tokenization via gateway SDK.

---

### STEP 1 — Production Code Audit

**Architecture finding — Stripe.js + PaymentIntents flow:**

1. Server calls `StripePaymentService::createPaymentIntent()` (amount, currency, metadata only — no card data).
2. Server returns `client_secret` to the browser.
3. Browser mounts Stripe Payment Element (`elements.create('payment')`) — card fields rendered entirely inside Stripe's iframe.
4. Browser calls `stripe.confirmPayment()` — card data sent directly to Stripe, **never through our server**.
5. Stripe redirects to `/checkout/success` with `payment_intent` query param.
6. Webhook handler (`handleWebhook`) reads only `event.data.object.id` (intent ID) to update order status.

**Schema audit — `orders` table columns:**

- ✅ `stripe_payment_intent_id` — Stripe token (safe to store, not card data)
- ✅ `stripe_client_secret` — used by Stripe.js to complete confirmation
- ❌ No `card_number`, `cvv`, `cvc`, `expiry`, `pan` columns exist

**Model audit — `Order::$fillable`:**

- Contains `stripe_payment_intent_id` and `stripe_client_secret`
- Does **not** contain any card data field

**Service audit — `StripePaymentService`:**

- Wraps official `\Stripe\StripeClient` SDK
- No `curl_init`, no raw HTTP card submission

**Interface audit — `PaymentServiceInterface`:**

- `createPaymentIntent(int $amountCents, string $currency, array $metadata)` — no card parameters
- `constructWebhookEvent(string $payload, string $sigHeader, string $secret)` — no card parameters

**Verdict:** Codebase is fully PCI-compliant by design. No production code changes required.

## EVAL-OH-001 — Order History Page

<!-- EVAL-OH-001 START -->

**Task ID:** OH-001
**Sprint:** 4
**Date:** 2026-04-16
**Branch:** `feature/OH-001` → `master`
**Tag:** `v1.0-OH-001-stable`
**Requirement:** As a user, I want to view my order history so I can track all past purchases. Listed newest-first with order ID, date, total, status. Paginated (10/page).

---

### STEP 1 — Implementation

**New files:**

- `app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php` — `index()` queries `auth()->user()->orders()->latest()->paginate(10)`
- `resources/views/orders/index.blade.php` — table with Order #, Date, Total, Status badge; empty state; `$orders->links()` pagination
- `database/factories/OrderFactory.php` — factory for test data generation

**Modified files:**

- `app/Models/User.php` — added `orders(): HasMany` relationship
- `app/Models/Order.php` — added `HasFactory` trait
- `routes/web.php` — added `GET /orders` → `OrderController@index` (name: `orders.index`) inside `auth` middleware group

**Security:** Route is inside the `auth` middleware group — guests are redirected to login. Each query is scoped to `auth()->user()->orders()` — users can never see another user's orders.

### STEP 2 — Test Cases

| TC    | Test Name                                                   | Result  |

### STEP 5 — Proposals for Next Task

- **OH-002 (Order Detail)** — view items, quantities, prices, shipping address, payment status for a single order

<!-- EVAL-OH-001 END -->

---

## EVAL-OH-002 — Order Detail Page

<!-- EVAL-OH-002 START -->

**Task ID:** OH-002
**Sprint:** 4
**Date:** 2026-04-16
**Branch:** `feature/OH-002` → `master`
**Tag:** `v1.0-OH-002-stable`
**Requirement:** As a user, I want to view the detail of a past order so I can see exactly what was bought. Shows items, quantities, prices, shipping address, payment method, status timeline.

---

### STEP 1 — Implementation

**New files:**

- `resources/views/orders/show.blade.php` — items table (product name, qty, unit price, subtotal), order summary (subtotal / shipping / total), shipping address (from JSON `address` cast), payment method (Stripe — PaymentIntent + intent ID), status badge + updated_at
- `database/factories/OrderItemFactory.php` — factory for `OrderItem` test data
- `tests/Feature/OrderDetailTest.php` — 12 tests

**Modified files:**

- `app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php` — added `show(Order $order)`: 403 guard for non-owners, `$order->load('items')`, returns `orders.show` view
- `app/Models/OrderItem.php` — added `HasFactory` trait
- `routes/web.php` — added `GET /orders/{order}` → `OrderController@show` (name: `orders.show`) inside `auth` middleware group
- `resources/views/orders/index.blade.php` — order ID cell now links to `route('orders.show', $order)`

**Security:** Route is inside the `auth` middleware group — guests are redirected to login. `show()` checks `$order->user_id !== auth()->id()` and calls `abort(403)` for non-owners — users can never view another user's order.

<!-- EVAL-OH-002 END -->

---

## EVAL-OH-003 — Order Status Tracking

<!-- EVAL-OH-003 START -->

**Task ID:** OH-003
**Sprint:** 4
**Date:** 2026-04-16
**Branch:** `feature/OH-003` → `master`
**Tag:** `v1.0-OH-003-stable`
**Requirement:** As a user, I want to track my order status so I know when it will arrive. Status steps: Pending → Processing → Shipped → Delivered. Timestamps for each step. Email notification on status change.

---

### STEP 1 — Implementation

**New files:**

- `database/migrations/2026_04_16_000001_add_status_timestamps_to_orders_table.php` — adds `processing_at`, `shipped_at`, `delivered_at` nullable timestamp columns
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/OrderStatusController.php` — `update(Request, Order)`: validates status in `['processing','shipped','delivered']`, sets the corresponding `_at` timestamp, sends `OrderStatusChanged` mail, redirects back
- `app/Mail/OrderStatusChanged.php` — mailable with subject "Order #X Status Update"
- `resources/views/mail/order-status-changed.blade.php` — email view showing new status label, items table, order total
- `tests/Feature/OrderStatusTest.php` — 12 tests

**Modified files:**

- `database/migrations/2026_04_15_210000_create_orders_table.php` — expanded status enum to include `processing`, `shipped`, `delivered`
- `app/Models/Order.php` — added `processing_at`, `shipped_at`, `delivered_at` to `$fillable` and `$casts` (datetime)
- `database/factories/OrderFactory.php` — added `processing()`, `shipped()`, `delivered()` states
- `resources/views/orders/show.blade.php` — replaced simple status badge with 4-step timeline (Placed / Processing / Shipped / Delivered) with timestamps and CSS styling
- `routes/web.php` — added `PATCH /admin/orders/{order}/status` → `OrderStatusController@update` (name: `admin.orders.status`) inside `auth + role:admin` group

**Security:** Route is inside the `auth` + `role:admin` middleware group — unauthenticated users redirect to login, non-admin users get 403. Status values are validated via `Rule::in()` — arbitrary strings are rejected with 422.

### STEP 5 — Proposals for Next Task

- **OH-004 (Order Cancellation)** — allow user to cancel a pending/paid order with confirmation and optional refund trigger

<!-- EVAL-OH-003 END -->

---

## EVAL-OH-004 — Order Cancellation

<!-- EVAL-OH-004 START -->

**Task ID:** OH-004
**Sprint:** 4
**Date:** 2026-04-16
**Branch:** `feature/OH-004` → `master`
**Tag:** `v1.0-OH-004-stable`
**Requirement:** As a user, I want to cancel a pending order so I can change my mind before it ships. Cancellation only allowed in "pending" status. Refund initiated automatically via gateway API. Stock restored on cancellation.

---

### STEP 1 — Implementation

**New files:**

- `tests/Feature/OrderCancellationTest.php` — 12 tests

**Modified files:**

- `app/Services/PaymentServiceInterface.php` — added `cancelPaymentIntent(string $intentId): void`
- `app/Services/StripePaymentService.php` — implemented `cancelPaymentIntent` via `$this->stripe->paymentIntents->cancel($intentId)`
- `app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php` — added constructor injection of `PaymentServiceInterface`; added `cancel(Order $order)`: ownership check (403), status guard (pending only), cancels Stripe PaymentIntent if set, restores product stock for items with known `product_id`, sets status to `cancelled`, redirects to `orders.index` with success flash
- `routes/web.php` — added `POST /orders/{order}/cancel` → `OrderController@cancel` (name: `orders.cancel`) inside `auth` middleware group
- `resources/views/orders/show.blade.php` — added Cancel Order button (red, with JS confirm dialog) shown only when `$order->status === 'pending'`; added error flash display
- `tests/Feature/PaymentTokenizationTest.php` — updated two anonymous class stubs to implement new `cancelPaymentIntent` method

**Security:** Route is inside the `auth` middleware group. Ownership check (`abort(403)`) prevents users cancelling others’ orders. Status guard prevents cancellation of non-pending orders. Cancel form uses `@csrf` token.

---

### Technical Notes

- **Migration** — `2026_04_17_000001_add_status_images_to_products_table.php` adds `status` (default `published`) and `images` (JSON) to the products table.
- **`scopePublished`** — added to `Product` model. `ProductController` public index/search now chain `->published()` so draft products are invisible on the storefront.
- **Slug uniqueness** — `uniqueSlug()` private helper appends an incrementing suffix if a slug already exists (e.g., `widget`, `widget-1`, `widget-2`).
- **Image storage** — Files stored via `Storage::disk('public')` under `products/`. The first image path is also written to the legacy `image` column for backward compatibility with existing product cards.
- **Multi-upload pattern** — `name="images[]"` + `enctype="multipart/form-data"`, validated as `array` + each `image|max:2048`.
- **Mocked Dependencies:** `Storage::fake('public')` in TC-PM001-08 — no real filesystem writes during tests.
- **GD extension** — Was commented out in `C:\xampp\php\php.ini`. Enabled during this sprint. Also restored the 2 UP-001 ProfileTest avatar tests that were previously failing.

### Technical Notes

- **`audit_logs` migration** — `2026_04_17_000002_create_audit_logs_table.php` creates `audit_logs` table with `user_id` (nullable FK), `action`, `subject_type`, `subject_id`, `old_values` (JSON), `new_values` (JSON).
- **`AuditLog` model** — `$fillable` for all columns; `old_values`/`new_values` cast to `array`; belongs to `User`.
- **`uniqueSlug` updated** — now accepts optional `?int $excludeId` to skip the current product's own slug when checking uniqueness during edit.
- **Images append** — new uploads are appended to the existing `images` JSON array rather than replacing it.
- **Storefront immediacy** — no cache layer; `scopePublished` is re-evaluated on each request, so status changes are instant.
- **Targeted regression rule** — for PM-002 (Sprint 5, Epic 9): run PM-002 tests + Done tasks in same sprint (PM-001) + Done tasks in same epic (PM-001). Result: 24/24.

### Technical Notes

- **`SoftDeletes` trait** — added to `Product` model. Laravel's global scope automatically excludes soft-deleted rows from all queries (`index`, `search`, storefront listing, detail page) without any additional code.
- **`deleted_at` migration** — `2026_04_17_000003_add_deleted_at_to_products_table.php` adds nullable `deleted_at` timestamp via `$table->softDeletes()`.
- **Route model binding + 404** — once a product is soft-deleted, route model binding on `{product}` (by slug) returns 404 automatically — no extra guard needed.
- **JS confirmation modal** — implemented via `data-confirm` attribute on the delete `<form>` + a `querySelectorAll` listener that calls `confirm()` before submit. No modal library required.
- **Audit log** — records `action=product.deleted` with `old_values` (name, slug, status) and `new_values` (deleted_at timestamp).
- **Targeted regression rule (task_template updated)** — regression now runs current task + Done tasks in same Sprint + Done tasks in same Epic (replaces full suite requirement).

None.

### Technical Notes

- **`parent_id` FK** — migration `2026_04_17_000004` adds nullable self-referencing `parent_id` with `nullOnDelete()`. Children are not cascade-deleted; their `parent_id` is nullified.
- **Category hierarchy** — implemented as a simple adjacency list. The `parent()` and `children()` relationships on the Category model are sufficient for one-level depth (parent/child). Deep trees would require recursive CTEs or a nested-set library — out of scope for this task.
- **Self-parent guard** — `Rule::notIn([$category->id])` in the update validation prevents a category from being set as its own parent. Children are excluded from the parent dropdown in the edit view via PHP filtering.
- **Product category filter (AC-3)** — `AdminProductController::index()` now accepts `?category_id=` query param and filters via `where('category_id', ...)`. The `$categories` collection is passed to the view to populate the dropdown. `withQueryString()` on the paginator preserves the filter across pagination.
- **`destroy()` cascade** — manually nullifies `products.category_id` (via `update`) and children's `parent_id` before hard-deleting the category. This is safe because both are nullable FKs.

| Performance   | 5/5   | Background job strategy prevents long blocking request for large files                              |
| Test Coverage | 5/5   | Covers auth, validation, row-level error reporting, category mapping, queue behavior, and UI output |

---

### Bugs / Side Effects Found

- While running PM-005 full regression, AD-003 empty-state string in dashboard view had a line-break mismatch; normalized back to single-line text to keep existing AD-003 test stable.

---

### Technical Notes

- Added table `product_imports` to persist import lifecycle (`pending` → `processing` → `completed`/`failed`) and per-row errors.
- CSV header contract is strict and case-insensitive normalized to: `name,description,price,stock,status,category`.
- Row validation rules:
  - `name` required, max 255
  - `price` numeric >= 0.01
  - `stock` integer >= 0
  - `status` in `draft|published`
  - `category` optional; if provided must match existing category name
- Job persists row errors in JSON with format: `[{row: <line>, messages: [..]}]` for audit and UI display.
- Product creation from CSV auto-generates unique slug and synthetic unique SKU (`CSV-<random>`).

## EVAL-PM-006 · Admin Product Image Management

**Date:** 2025-01-18  
**Branch:** `feature/PM-006`  
**Tag:** `v1.0-PM-006-stable`  
**Status:** ✅ PASS

### User Story

As an admin, I want to manage product images so each product looks appealing.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Multiple images per product (stored as JSON array in `images` column)
- [x] Drag-to-reorder images (saves new order via POST endpoint)
- [x] One image set as thumbnail (`image` column)
- [x] Remove individual images by index

### Files Changed

| File                                                          | Change                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ecommerce/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/ProductController.php`  | Added `images()`, `reorderImages()`, `setThumbnail()`, `destroyImage()` methods |
| `ecommerce/routes/web.php`                                    | Added 4 PM-006 routes under admin prefix                                        |
| `ecommerce/resources/views/admin/products/images.blade.php`   | New view: image list with drag-to-reorder, set-thumbnail, remove                |
| `ecommerce/resources/views/admin/products/edit.blade.php`     | Added "Manage Images →" link                                                    |
| `ecommerce/tests/Feature/AdminProductImageManagementTest.php` | 13 feature tests                                                                |

### Test Results

| Suite                                  | Tests | Assertions | Failures |
| -------------------------------------- | ----- | ---------- | -------- |
| PM-006 targeted                        | 13    | 31         | 0        |
| Targeted regression (product+category) | 73    | 187        | 0        |

### Security Checks

- `reorderImages` only accepts paths already in `$product->images` — prevents path injection
- `destroyImage` uses index (integer), not arbitrary file path — no directory traversal
- All routes require `admin` role via middleware
- No raw file system calls; image paths are stored references only

### Improvement Proposals

| -------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| PM-006.1 | Add file upload endpoint to images page | Allow uploading new images directly from management page | High     |
| PM-006.2 | Store image dimensions/metadata in JSON | Enables responsive image selection                       | Medium   |
| PM-006.3 | Add bulk delete option                  | Faster cleanup for products with many images             | Low      |

**Branch:** `feature/OM-004`  
**Tag:** `v1.0-OM-004-stable`  
**Status:** ✅ PASS

### User Story

As an admin, I want to export orders to CSV so I can share data with logistics partners.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Filtered result set is exported (status, date range, customer filters all applied)
- [x] CSV includes Order ID, Customer Name, Customer Email, Items, Total, Status, Date
- [x] Response is a file download (Content-Disposition: attachment)
- [x] Export CSV button visible on admin orders index

### Files Changed

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ecommerce/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/OrderController.php` | Added `export()` method with filter support and streamed CSV download |
| `ecommerce/routes/web.php`                                 | Added `GET /admin/orders/export` route (before `{order}` wildcard)    |
| `ecommerce/resources/views/admin/orders/index.blade.php`   | Added Export CSV link passing current filter params                   |
| `ecommerce/tests/Feature/AdminOrderExportCsvTest.php`      | 14 feature tests                                                      |

### Test Results

| Suite                                  | Tests | Assertions | Failures |
| -------------------------------------- | ----- | ---------- | -------- |
| OM-004 targeted                        | 14    | 37         | 0        |
| Targeted regression (order management) | 50    | 116        | 0        |
| Full suite (pre-commit hook)           | 586   | 1338       | 0        |

### Security Checks

- Export endpoint behind `auth` + `role:admin` middleware — no public access
- Filters use Eloquent query builder with parameter binding — no SQL injection
- `streamDownload` uses `php://output` via `fputcsv` — no arbitrary file writes
- No user-controlled data used in filename (only `now()->format('Y-m-d')` appended)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Calls Payment Gateway refund API
- Order status set to "Refunded"
- Refund amount recorded in transaction log

| Controller                      | `ecommerce/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/RefundController.php`                                                |

**Key design decisions:**

- `RefundController::store()` guards: order must be `cancelled` and have a `stripe_payment_intent_id`
- Full order total is refunded (in cents) via `PaymentServiceInterface::refund()`
- `refund_transactions` table records `order_id`, `amount`, and `stripe_refund_id`
- `orders.status` enum extended to include `refunded`; `refunded_at` timestamp added
- "Process Refund" button shown in admin order detail only when `status === 'cancelled'` and intent exists
- Confirmation dialog before submitting the refund form

**Key design decisions:**

- `UserController::index()` uses `withCount('orders')` and `with('roles')` to avoid N+1
- Search filters by `name` or `email` using `LIKE` (case-insensitive)
- Paginated at 20 per page with `withQueryString()` to preserve search param in pagination links

| Controller  | `ecommerce/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/UserController.php` (added `toggleStatus()`)                      |
| Login block | `ecommerce/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/LoginController.php` (is_active check after Auth::attempt)         |
| View        | `ecommerce/resources/views/admin/users/show.blade.php` (status display + toggle button with JS confirm) |
| Route       | `ecommerce/routes/web.php` (`PATCH /admin/users/{user}/toggle-status` → `admin.users.toggle-status`)    |
| Tests       | `ecommerce/tests/Feature/AdminUserToggleStatusTest.php`                                                 |

**Key design decisions:**

- `toggleStatus()` uses `! $user->is_active` to flip the flag in one DB call
- Admin is blocked from suspending their own account (returns error flash, no DB change)
- Suspended login check: after `Auth::attempt()` succeeds, check `is_active`, log out immediately if false, redirect with `email` error
- JS `confirm()` dialog provides the client-side confirmation UX
- CSRF protected via `@csrf` + `@method('PATCH')`

## EVAL-UM-004 · Admin Assign/Change User Roles

**Version:** A  
**Date:** 2026-04-18  
**Status in Backlog:** Done  
**Linked Task:** [UM-004](backlog.md)  
**Tag:** `v1.0-UM-004-stable`

---

### Task Definition

> As an admin, I want to assign or change user roles so I can promote users to admins.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Role dropdown: user / admin
- Audit log records who changed the role and when

### Implementation Summary

| Area       | File(s)                                                                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Controller | `ecommerce/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/UserController.php` (added `assignRole()`)                 |
| View       | `ecommerce/resources/views/admin/users/show.blade.php` (role dropdown + Save Role button)        |
| Route      | `ecommerce/routes/web.php` (`PATCH /admin/users/{user}/assign-role` → `admin.users.assign-role`) |
| Tests      | `ecommerce/tests/Feature/AdminUserAssignRoleTest.php`                                            |

**Key design decisions:**

- `syncRoles([$newRole])` ensures user has exactly one role (replaces old role atomically)
- Role validation: `in:user,admin` — only two valid values
- Admin blocked from changing own role (returns error flash, no DB change)
- `AuditLog` record stores `user_id` (who changed), `subject_id` (whose role), `old_values.role`, `new_values.role`
- Blade `select#role_select` pre-selects current role via `$user->hasRole('user')`/`hasRole('admin')`
- JS `confirm()` dialog for client-side confirmation; CSRF protected via `@csrf` + `@method('PATCH')`

| Simplicity    | 5/5   | Controller is 48 lines; all filters are additive `when()` / `where()` — no branching complexity    |
| Security      | 5/5   | `auth`+`role:admin` double guard; all user input goes through Eloquent query bindings — no raw SQL |
| Performance   | 5/5   | `with('user')` eager-loads to avoid N+1; `withQueryString()` preserves filters across pagination   |
| Test Coverage | 5/5   | 12 cases — 6× happy (filter/sort), 2× edge (combined, no-filter), 2× security, 2× AC (pagination)  |

### Bugs / Side Effects Found

### Technical Notes

- **Route naming** — `admin.orders.index` is new. The existing `admin.orders.status` (OH-003 PATCH) is a separate route. No conflict.
- **`reorder()` vs `orderBy()`** — `latest()` pre-sets `ORDER BY created_at DESC`. Using `reorder()` clears that and applies the selected sort. This is intentional so the sort dropdown fully controls ordering.
- **Customer filter** — uses `whereHas('user', fn => orWhere name/email like %)`. Partial-match, case-insensitive (SQLite `LIKE` is case-insensitive for ASCII by default).
- **`withQueryString()`** — ensures all active filters are appended to pagination links, preventing loss of filter state on page change.
- **View** — status badges are styled with per-status CSS classes. The sort links toggle direction on repeated click (newest ↔ oldest, total_asc ↔ total_desc).

### Bugs Found

None.

### New Files

## EVAL-RV-001 · Product Reviews

**Story:** RV-001 — As a user, I want to leave a review and star rating on a purchased product so others benefit from my experience.

**Sprint:** 7 | **Epic:** 7 — Product Reviews | **Points:** 5

---

### STEP 1 — Architecture Review

- **Migration** `2026_04_17_000008_create_product_reviews_table.php` — `product_reviews` table: `id`, `user_id` (FK → cascadeOnDelete), `product_id` (FK → cascadeOnDelete), `rating` (unsignedTinyInteger 1–5), `comment` (text), timestamps, unique constraint on `(user_id, product_id)`
- **`Review` model** — `$table = 'product_reviews'`; `$fillable = ['user_id', 'product_id', 'rating', 'comment']`; `rating` cast to `integer`; `belongsTo User` and `belongsTo Product`
- **`Product` model** — `reviews(): HasMany` relationship added; `HasMany` import added
- **`User` model** — `reviews(): HasMany` relationship added
- **`ReviewController::store()`** — auth enforced via middleware; purchase gate via `Order::whereIn('status', ['paid','processing','shipped','delivered'])->whereHas('items', ...)` ; duplicate-review guard; validation `rating:integer|min:1|max:5`, `comment:required|string|max:2000`; on success redirect to product page with `session('success')` flash
- **`ProductController::show()`** — now computes `$canReview` (purchased and not yet reviewed) and `$userReview` (own existing review) and passes both to view
- **Route** `POST /products/{product:slug}/reviews` → `reviews.store` (auth middleware); placed after the public `GET /products/{product:slug}` show route

---

### STEP 2 — Security Checklist

- [x] Auth middleware on review route — guests redirect to login
- [x] Purchase gate — unpurchased users receive redirect with error, review not stored
- [x] Duplicate guard — second attempt redirected with error, count stays at 1
- [x] Rating validated `min:1|max:5` — values 0 and 6 rejected
- [x] Comment required and max:2000 — empty string rejected
- [x] XSS: all Blade output via `{{ }}` auto-escaped
- [x] CSRF: `@csrf` in form
- [x] `product_id` derived from route model binding — not user-supplied

## EVAL-RV-002 · Review Listing

**Story:** RV-002 — As a user, I want to see reviews on a product page so I can make informed decisions.

**Sprint:** 7 | **Epic:** 7 — Product Reviews | **Points:** 2

---

### STEP 1 — Architecture Review

- **`ProductController::show()`** — updated to additionally compute `$reviews` (`product->reviews()->with('user')->latest()->paginate(5)`) and `$averageRating` (`product->reviews()->avg('rating')`); both passed to view via `compact()`
- **`ReviewController::store()`** — after inserting the new review, recalculates and saves `product.rating = round(avg(reviews.rating), 2)`, keeping the denormalised column in sync for the `scopeFilter` / `scopeSort` functionality
- **`products/show.blade.php`** — Customer Reviews section overhauled:
  - Average rating shown prominently with `number_format($averageRating, 1)` and review count
  - "No reviews yet." message when `$reviews->isEmpty()`
  - Paginated reviews list (name, rating, comment per item) with `$reviews->links()`
  - `$userReview` separate block removed — user's own review appears naturally in the list
  - RV-001 review submission form retained unchanged

---

### STEP 2 — Security Checklist

- [x] Reviews visible to guests — no auth required for view (public product page)
- [x] All output via `{{ }}` — XSS safe
- [x] `avg()` returns `null` when no reviews; guarded with `@if ($averageRating !== null)` to prevent rendering errors
- [x] Pagination uses Eloquent's `paginate()` — no raw SQL

### Regression Note

Fixed `NotifyAdminOfNewOrder::handle()` — replaced `User::role('admin')->get()` (Spatie scope that throws `RoleDoesNotExist` when role is absent) with `User::whereHas('roles', fn($q) => $q->where('name', 'admin'))->get()` to prevent 500 in tests without pre-seeded roles.

**Overall: 5.0 / 5.0**

### Bugs Found

None.

### Notes

Migration adds `low_stock_threshold` (nullable unsigned int) and `low_stock_notified` (boolean, default false) to products table. Controller logic: if new stock > threshold reset flag; if stock ≤ threshold and not yet notified, dispatch job and set flag. Null threshold skips all logic entirely.

None.

### Notes

`IMAGE_DISK` env var (default: `s3`) controls all image/avatar uploads. Set `IMAGE_DISK=public` locally or in `phpunit.xml` to use local storage. `ProductController` and `ProfileController` updated to use `config('filesystems.image_disk', 's3')`. S3 disk has `visibility: public` and `use_path_style_endpoint` for MinIO/S3-compatible services.

## EVAL-IMP-001 · Bento Grid Layout for Product Catalog

**Improvement ID:** IMP-001
**Scope:** `[UIUX_MODE]`
**Version:** A
**Date:** 2026-04-19
**Status in Backlog:** Done
**Target Task IDs:** PC-001
**Git Tag:** v1.0-IMP-001-stable

### What Was Changed

- Replaced the bare-HTML `products/index.blade.php` with a full Bootstrap 5 page
- Added a sticky left sidebar (col-lg-3) containing the filter form (`id="filter-form"` preserved)
- Replaced the plain `<div class="product-grid">` with a CSS-Grid **Bento layout** (3-col desktop, 2-col tablet, 1-col mobile)
- First product card is the **featured hero** cell — spans 2 columns × 2 rows with a taller image (340 px)
- All remaining cards are standard cells with 180 px images and consistent Bootstrap card markup
- Added Bootstrap 5 navbar with search bar, Cart, Orders, Login/Register/Logout links
- Added category badges, star rating display (full/half/empty), In Stock / Out of Stock status badges
- Empty state upgraded from `<p>` to Bootstrap `.alert.alert-info`
- Pagination wrapped in `.d-flex.justify-content-center`
- All Blade output remains `{{ }}` — XSS-safe (OWASP §2 verified)

### Test Results

**New PHPUnit tests:** N/A — `[UIUX_MODE]` scope, no server-side logic changed
**Regression suite:** 821/821 ✅ (run on `master` before branch creation — commit `ffccd94`)

### Summary

Applied shimmer skeleton screens to all genuinely async-loading UI areas across the product catalog and admin dashboard, using pure CSS `@keyframes` + vanilla JS — no new libraries.

### Changes Made

#### `ecommerce/resources/views/products/index.blade.php`

- Added `@keyframes skel-shimmer` + `.skel-img` CSS rule in the `<style>` block (placed before the responsive breakpoints section).
- Changed `<img class="card-img-top">` → `<img class="card-img-top skel-img" loading="lazy" onload="this.classList.remove('skel-img')">` for all product images.
- The shimmer gradient is visible while the browser fetches the image; `onload` fires and removes the class the moment the image has decoded, giving a clean progressive reveal.

#### `ecommerce/resources/views/admin/dashboard.blade.php`

- Added `@keyframes skel-shimmer`, `.kpi-card.kpi-loading .kpi-value / .kpi-label` rules, `.skel-chart-wrap`, `#chart-skeleton`, and `#chart-skeleton.hidden` CSS to the `<style>` block.
- Added `kpi-loading` class to all 4 `.kpi-card` elements in HTML; a `DOMContentLoaded` JS listener removes it immediately once the DOM is ready — so values are always present in the HTML source (test-safe) but visually shimmer for the ~0 ms until JS runs.
- Wrapped `<canvas id="revenue-chart">` inside `<div class="skel-chart-wrap">` and injected `<div id="chart-skeleton">` as a sibling before the canvas.
- Updated `loadChart(range)` to call `skeleton.classList.remove('hidden')` at the top of the function (before `fetch`) and `skeleton.classList.add('hidden')` after `new Chart(...)` renders, so the shimmer covers the blank canvas on every range switch.

### Test Regression Assessment

- `[UIUX_MODE]` — no PHPUnit test changes required.
- All existing test constraints preserved:
  - `id="revenue-chart"` canvas attribute unchanged.
  - `data-range="daily"/"weekly"/"monthly"` buttons unchanged.
  - `cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js` CDN script unchanged.
  - `assertSee('Total Revenue')` etc. — KPI labels remain in source.
  - `assertSee('250.00')` — KPI values are server-rendered into `class="kpi-value"` divs; `color: transparent` is CSS-only and invisible to PHPUnit's HTML parser.
  - `id="filter-form"`, sort options, `No products available`, `In Stock`/`Out of Stock` — all unchanged in `products/index.blade.php`.
- Full PHPUnit suite (821 tests) will run at commit; no regressions anticipated.

### Security Notes

- All Blade output uses `{{ }}` (HTML-escaped). No `{!! !!}` introduced.
- `onload` handler on `<img>` only calls `this.classList.remove(...)` — no user data involved.
- No new HTTP endpoints, no controller/model/route changes.

### Upgrade Proposals

- IMP-003: Lazy-load below-the-fold bento cards with Intersection Observer
- IMP-010: Product image lightbox + zoom on the detail card

### Summary

Collapsed the three-step checkout flow (Address → Shipping → Review) into a single `/checkout` page. The user fills address and shipping on one screen, clicks **Review & Pay**, which saves both to session via a lightweight AJAX endpoint, initialises a Stripe PaymentIntent, and mounts the Stripe Payment Element inline — all without any page navigation.

The existing multi-step routes (`/checkout/address`, `/checkout/shipping`, `/checkout/review`) are **preserved unchanged** for backward-compatibility and existing test coverage.

### Changes Made

#### `ecommerce/routes/web.php`

- Added `GET /checkout` → `CheckoutController@showCheckout` (name: `checkout.index`)
- Added `POST /checkout/session` → `CheckoutController@storeSession` (name: `checkout.session.store`)
- Both routes sit inside the existing `auth` middleware group, adjacent to the existing checkout routes.

#### `ecommerce/app/Http/Controllers/CheckoutController.php`

- **`showCheckout()`** — Returns `checkout.index` view with `$cart`, `$addresses`, `$shippingOptions`, and `$subtotal`. Pure read — no side effects.
- **`storeSession()`** — AJAX endpoint that accepts either `address_id` (existing saved address) or a full address payload (new address — validated + persisted), plus `method` (validated against known shipping keys). Writes `checkout.address` and `checkout.shipping` to session and returns `{ok, subtotal, shipping_cost, discount, total}` JSON. The existing `placeOrder()` endpoint is called second by the frontend using the now-populated session — no changes to `placeOrder()`.

#### `ecommerce/resources/views/checkout/index.blade.php` _(new file)_

- Bootstrap 5 two-column layout: left column = address fields + shipping radios + "Review & Pay" CTA; right column = order summary table + live shipping/total update + payment panel.
- Saved addresses rendered as radio buttons (with "Enter a new address" option to toggle the form fields).
- JS flow: `collectFormData()` → POST to `checkout.session.store` → update summary → POST to `checkout.place-order` → mount `stripe.elements()` → reveal `#payment-section` → on "Pay" click, `stripe.confirmPayment()` with `return_url: /checkout/success`.
- `<meta name="csrf-token">` used for all AJAX headers — no plain-text token in JS strings.
- All server-side output uses `{{ }}` (XSS-safe); no `{!! !!}`.

#### `ecommerce/tests/Feature/OnePageCheckoutTest.php` _(new file)_

- 18 test cases covering: GET 200 / guest redirect / cart items / address fields / shipping options / saved addresses / Stripe.js CDN / delivery info / POST with new address / POST with saved address_id / address persisted to DB / totals in response / standard cost / express cost / missing address → 422 / invalid method → 422 / guest POST → 401 / total arithmetic.

### Test Results

```
Tests\Feature\OnePageCheckoutTest — 18 passed (42 assertions)
Full suite baseline (pre-IMP-003): 821 passed
Full suite post-IMP-003: 839 passed (821 + 18 new)
```

No regressions. All existing CP-001/CP-002/CP-003 tests continue to pass — multi-step routes untouched.

### Security Notes

- CSRF protected via `X-CSRF-TOKEN` header read from `<meta name="csrf-token">` (not embedded in JS string).
- `address_id` is scoped `WHERE user_id = auth()->id()` to prevent IDOR.
- No card data touches the server — Stripe tokenisation entirely client-side via Stripe.js (same pattern as existing CP-003).
- All `{{ }}` used in Blade — no `{!! !!}`.
- Validation applied to all user-submitted fields before any database write.

### Upgrade Proposals

- IMP-004: Guest Checkout (complete order without login)
- IMP-005: Apply `coupon` input field on the one-page checkout to replace the separate coupon step
